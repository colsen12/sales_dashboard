# sales_dashboard
A Power BI dashboard I created from MySQL database.

This repo contains a .pbix file, which is the interactive sales dashboard I created.
You will need to have Power BI software installed to open the .pbix file.

If you do not have Power BI software, you can open the .pdf file and view a static image of the dashboard.
The pdf version will not give an interactive view of the data and slicers.

I have also included the raw data in the form of a SQL database before it was transformed.
